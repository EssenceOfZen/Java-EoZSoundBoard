# Java-EoZSoundBoard
The Soundboard for the EoZ podcast. Meant to be modular down the road.


## Change-Log

#### Version 0.3.2

+ Program is now somewhat modular. Adding sound files to the proper directories will automatically add buttons.
+ System now creates the sound directories if, for whatever reason, they are deleted.
+ Reformatted the JavaFX design layout.

**Todo List**
+ Setup a "kill" button for when sounds are going on too long
+ Add media controls like time line and pause/play button
+ Integrate option/setting windows
